## A job board for while42, built with Rails, prismic.io and Bootstrap3

[While42](http://while42.org/) is a French Tech Engineers Alumni Network, [prismic.io](http://prismic.io) is a disruptive flexible approach to content management and delivery (full disclosure: I am their Developer Evangelist), and I don't need to introduce [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)!

This is based on the [prismic.io starter project for Rails](https://github.com/prismicio/ruby-rails-starter), which uses [prismic.io's Ruby gem](https://github.com/prismicio/ruby-kit). If you want to help out here, you should read their README files first.

Are also being used: [Bootstrap3](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [JQuery](http://jquery.com/).

The project is taylored to be immediately deployable on Heroku.

### Getting started

#### Install the project locally

*(Assuming you've installed the latest versions of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download), [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/download) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).)*

Fork and clone, then while in the right directory, run:
```bash
bundle install
rails server
```

#### Configure the project for your own prismic.io repository

This happens in the ```config/prismic.yml``` file; check out the [README file of the prismic.io starter project for Rails](https://github.com/prismicio/ruby-rails-starter).

### Contribute to the starter project
